This repository includes 3 tasks which i had performed as a part of CodSoft Data Science internship.


Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Task 2: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Task 3: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION


Note: There is no dataset attached with the task 3 because the size of dataset file was more than 25MB and i was not able to upload that dataset file in github.
